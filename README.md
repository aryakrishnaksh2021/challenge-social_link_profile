## My process
I began by building the layout of the design using HTML elements. Then, I added style classes to each element. After that, I incorporated media queries for responsive design. Finally, I conducted a Lighthouse audit for performance and accessibility, making adjustments according to best practices.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned more about the flex properties and gap  property in CSS, as well as how to use them effectively for layout. I also practiced using media query.
